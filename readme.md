# MinesweeperJS

A remake of the classic game found on Microsoft PCs in the 90s and 2000s, but with a modern look.

## How to play

- There is a number of mines hidden in the blocks and your mission is to find them all without detonating them
- A block can either contain a number (indication how many mines it's adjacent to), a blank (it is not adjacent to any mines), or a mine (ending the game).
- The blocks with numbers indicate how many mines are located in neighboring blocks (each block has 8 neightbor blocks that can contain a mine).
- In order to figure out where the mines are, you can use the numbered blocks as hints as they indicate exactly how many mines are adjacent to it.
- You can right click on a block in order to flag it if you think it contains a mine, after which the block will be disabled
- In order to win the game, you must find all of the non-mine blocks
